# Kanon-Development Orchestration Patterns

This directory contains the orchestration patterns that drive autonomous
development of [`kelos-dev/kanon`](https://github.com/kelos-dev/kanon) — a Go
CLI that manages coding-agent settings (instructions, skills, MCP servers,
hooks, permissions) across multiple machines.

It mirrors [`self-development/`](../), which does the same for
this repository (`kelos-dev/kelos`). The configs live here, in the kelos
repository, but the webhook filters and Workspaces target `kelos-dev/kanon`, so
the agents they spawn operate on the Kanon repository.

## How It Works

Each TaskSpawner references an `AgentConfig` that defines git identity, comment
signatures, and standard constraints. Some agents (pr-responder, triage,
squash-commits) share the base `agentconfig.yaml` (`kanon-dev-agent`), while
others (workers, planner, reviewer, fake-user, fake-strategist) define their own
`AgentConfig` inline.

Autonomous discovery agents that publish GitHub issues maintain at most one
open `generated-by-kelos` issue slot per TaskSpawner. The issue body includes a
`kelos-taskspawner=<name>` marker so later runs can find it. A run may update
the unassigned slot when it finds a clearly more impactful or important
candidate, but it exits without changes when the slot has assignees. Assigned
issues and PRs are treated as ongoing human or agent work and are not updated by
autonomous discovery jobs. This cap does not apply to follow-up issues created
while a worker or PR responder is handling an explicitly requested issue or PR.

Eight spawners operate directly on the Kanon repository through the
`kanon-agent` Workspace. The two meta-maintenance spawners
(`kanon-config-update`, `kanon-self-update`) are different: the files they
maintain (`self-development/kanon/*`) live in *this* repository, so they use the
`kelos-agent` Workspace and the `kelos-dev-agent` AgentConfig from
`self-development/`, and they read Kanon's activity cross-repo with
`gh ... --repo kelos-dev/kanon`.

## TaskSpawners

| TaskSpawner | Trigger | Agent | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **kanon-workers** | Webhook: issue comment `/kelos pick-up` | Codex | Picks up issues, creates or updates PRs, self-reviews, and ensures CI passes |
| **kanon-planner** | Webhook: issue comment `/kelos plan` | Codex | Investigates an issue and posts a structured implementation plan — advisory only, no code changes |
| **kanon-reviewer** | Webhook: PR comment `/kelos review` | Codex | Reviews PRs on demand — analyzes code, checks conventions, and updates a sticky review comment |
| **kanon-pr-responder** | Webhook: PR review/comment with `/kelos pick-up` | Codex | Re-engages on PR review feedback and updates the existing branch incrementally |
| **kanon-triage** | Webhook: issue opened/reopened (untriaged) | Codex | Classifies issues by kind/priority, detects duplicates, and recommends an actor |
| **kanon-fake-user** | Cron (daily 09:00 UTC) | Codex | Tests DX as a new user and maintains one unassigned issue slot for the highest-impact problem found |
| **kanon-fake-strategist** | Cron (every 12 hours) | Codex | Explores new use cases, integrations, and managed-settings types while maintaining one unassigned strategic issue slot |
| **kanon-config-update** | Cron (daily 18:00 UTC) | Codex | Reviews recent Kanon PR feedback and creates or updates unassigned configuration PRs accordingly |
| **kanon-self-update** | Cron (daily 06:00 UTC) | Codex | Reviews and tunes the `self-development/kanon/` prompts, configs, and README while maintaining one unassigned improvement issue slot |
| **kanon-squash-commits** | Webhook: PR comment `/kelos squash-commits` | Codex | Rebases and squashes PR branch commits into a single clean commit |

> **Not ported from `self-development/`:** `kelos-api-reviewer` (Kanon has no
> Kubernetes CRDs/API surface to review) and `kelos-image-update` (Kanon has no
> coding-agent Dockerfiles to bump).

Apply the whole directory at once — this includes `agentconfig.yaml`, which
defines the shared `kanon-dev-agent` referenced by the pr-responder, triage, and
squash-commits spawners:

```bash
kubectl apply -f self-development/kanon/
```

The per-spawner `kubectl apply` commands below are for deploying or updating an
individual spawner.

### kanon-workers.yaml

Picks up open GitHub issues when a maintainer posts `/kelos pick-up` and creates autonomous agent tasks to fix them.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** | GitHub `issue_comment` webhook with `/kelos pick-up` |
| **Agent** | Codex |
| **Concurrency** | 8 |

**Key features:**
- Automatically checks for existing PRs and updates them incrementally
- Self-reviews PRs before requesting human review
- Ensures CI passes before completion
- Requires a `/kelos pick-up` comment to pick up an issue (maintainer approval gate)
- Hands off PR review feedback to `kanon-pr-responder`
- May create separate follow-up issues for out-of-scope discoveries; those
  follow-ups are exempt from the per-TaskSpawner issue slot cap

**Deploy:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f self-development/kanon/kanon-workers.yaml
```

### kanon-planner.yaml

Reacts to `/kelos plan` comments on open issues. Investigates the issue, inspects the codebase, and posts a structured implementation plan — advisory only, no code changes. For issues that touch a CLI command/flag or the `kanon.yaml` schema, the plan must resolve naming, shape, and backward compatibility up front.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** | GitHub `issue_comment` webhook with `/kelos plan` |
| **Agent** | Codex |
| **Concurrency** | 2 |

**Handoff flow:**
1. `/kelos plan` — requests or refreshes an implementation plan
2. `/kelos pick-up` — maintainer hands off to workers when ready

**Deploy:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f self-development/kanon/kanon-planner.yaml
```

### kanon-reviewer.yaml

Reviews open pull requests on demand when a maintainer posts `/kelos review` or when a Kanon worker posts `/kelos review` after pushing a generated PR and confirming CI passes.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** | GitHub PR comment webhook with `/kelos review` from a maintainer or Kanon worker handoff |
| **Agent** | Codex |
| **Concurrency** | 3 |

**Key features:**
- Uses the `review-all` skill to reconcile two independent reviews of the same diff
- Reads the full diff and surrounding context to understand changes
- Checks correctness, tests, project conventions, security, and code quality
- Pays special attention to CLI/config-surface changes (naming, shape, backward compatibility)
- Creates or updates a single sticky PR comment with the structured review result
- Summarizes specific file/line findings in the sticky comment without inline review comments
- Read-only agent — does not push code, modify files, or run local validation

**Handoff flow:**
1. `/kelos review` — maintainer requests a code review on the PR
2. `/kelos review` — worker hands off a generated PR for review after pushing changes and confirming CI passes
3. `/kelos review` — maintainer can retrigger review after changes are pushed

**Deploy:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f self-development/kanon/kanon-reviewer.yaml
```

### kanon-pr-responder.yaml

Picks up open GitHub pull requests when a reviewer requests changes with `/kelos pick-up`.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** | GitHub PR comment with `/kelos pick-up`, or a PR review whose body contains `/kelos pick-up` |
| **Agent** | Codex |
| **Concurrency** | 8 |

**Key features:**
- Reuses the existing PR branch instead of starting over
- Reads review comments and PR conversation before making incremental changes
- Lets the maintainer stay on the PR page for the common review-feedback loop
- Requires a `/kelos pick-up` PR comment or review body to be picked up
- May create separate follow-up issues for out-of-scope discoveries; those
  follow-ups are exempt from the per-TaskSpawner issue slot cap

**Deploy:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f self-development/kanon/kanon-pr-responder.yaml
```

### kanon-triage.yaml

Triages newly opened (and certain reopened) GitHub issues.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** | GitHub issue opened (no `triage-accepted`), or reopened with `needs-actor` |
| **Agent** | Codex |
| **Concurrency** | 8 |

**For each issue, the agent:**
1. Classifies with exactly one `kind/*` label (`kind/bug`, `kind/feature`, `kind/api`, `kind/docs`). `kind/api` covers any change to a user-facing surface — a CLI command or flag, or the `kanon.yaml` configuration schema.
2. Checks if the issue has already been fixed by a merged PR or recent commit
3. Checks if the issue references outdated commands, flags, or config fields
4. Detects duplicate issues
5. Assesses priority (`priority/important-soon`, `priority/important-longterm`, `priority/backlog`)
6. Recommends an actor — assigns `actor/kelos` if the issue has clear scope and verifiable criteria, otherwise `actor/human`. `kind/api` issues always get `actor/human` and are **not** marked `triage-accepted`, because new user-facing surface must be reviewed with a maintainer first.

Posts a single triage comment and adds `triage-accepted` to prevent re-triage.

**Deploy:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f self-development/kanon/kanon-triage.yaml
```

### kanon-fake-user.yaml

Runs daily to test the developer experience as if you were a new user.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** | Cron `0 9 * * *` (daily at 09:00 UTC) |
| **Agent** | Codex |
| **Concurrency** | 1 |

Each run picks one focus area:
- **Documentation & Onboarding** — follow the quick-start, test CLI help text
- **Developer Experience** — build, exercise init/validate/diff/apply/import, review error messages
- **Examples & Use Cases** — verify example config, identify missing examples

Creates or updates the single unassigned `kanon-fake-user` issue slot for the
highest-impact problem found. If that issue is assigned, the run treats it as
ongoing and exits without editing it or creating another issue.

**Deploy:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f self-development/kanon/kanon-fake-user.yaml
```

### kanon-fake-strategist.yaml

Runs every 12 hours to strategically explore new ways to use and improve Kanon.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** | Cron `0 */12 * * *` (every 12 hours) |
| **Agent** | Codex |
| **Concurrency** | 1 |

Each run picks one focus area:
- **New Use Cases** — explore teams/fleets/workflows that could benefit from managed agent settings
- **Integration Opportunities** — identify agents, tools, and toolchains Kanon could integrate with
- **New Managed-Settings Types & CLI Extensions** — propose new render targets, settings types, or `kanon.yaml` schema extensions

Creates or updates the single unassigned `kanon-fake-strategist` issue slot for
the highest-impact actionable insight. If that issue is assigned, the run treats
it as ongoing and exits without editing it or creating another issue.

**Deploy:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f self-development/kanon/kanon-fake-strategist.yaml
```

### kanon-config-update.yaml

Runs daily to update the Kanon agent configuration based on patterns found in Kanon's PR reviews.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** | Cron `0 18 * * *` (daily at 18:00 UTC) |
| **Agent** | Codex |
| **Workspace** | `kelos-agent` (edits `self-development/kanon/` in this repo) |
| **Concurrency** | 1 |

Reviews recent `kelos-dev/kanon` PRs and their review comments to identify recurring feedback patterns, then updates the configuration under `self-development/kanon/` (the shared `agentconfig.yaml` or a specific TaskSpawner prompt). Opens a PR against this repository using `/kind cleanup` and `release-note: NONE`, since it only touches `self-development/kanon/`.
Skips uncertain or contradictory feedback, and skips an existing configuration
PR when it has assignees.

**Deploy:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f self-development/kanon/kanon-config-update.yaml
```

### kanon-self-update.yaml

Runs daily to review and improve the `self-development/kanon/` workflow files themselves.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** | Cron `0 6 * * *` (daily at 06:00 UTC) |
| **Agent** | Codex |
| **Workspace** | `kelos-agent` (reasons about `self-development/kanon/` in this repo) |
| **Concurrency** | 1 |

Each run picks one focus area: **Prompt Tuning**, **Configuration Alignment**, or **Workflow Completeness**.

Creates or updates the single unassigned `kanon-self-update` issue slot for the
highest-impact actionable improvement. If that issue is assigned, the run treats
it as ongoing and exits without editing it or creating another issue.

**Deploy:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f self-development/kanon/kanon-self-update.yaml
```

### kanon-squash-commits.yaml

Rebases and squashes PR branch commits into a single clean commit when a maintainer posts `/kelos squash-commits`.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** | GitHub PR comment webhook with `/kelos squash-commits` |
| **Agent** | Codex |
| **Concurrency** | 1 |

**Key features:**
- Rebases the PR branch on `origin/main` and squashes all commits after the merge base into one
- Amends the squashed commit message based on the linked issue and PR description when needed
- Force-pushes with `--force-with-lease`
- Adds `kelos/needs-input` to the linked issue to signal the PR is ready for re-review
- Does not start new development work or modify source code

**Deploy:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f self-development/kanon/kanon-squash-commits.yaml
```

## Prerequisites

These spawners are applied to the same cluster that runs `self-development/`.
Before deploying them, set up the following.

### 1. Workspaces

Two Workspaces are referenced:

- **`kanon-agent`** — points at the Kanon repository (used by all spawners except the two meta-maintenance ones):

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: kelos.dev/v1alpha2
  kind: Workspace
  metadata:
    name: kanon-agent
  spec:
    repo: https://github.com/kelos-dev/kanon.git
    ref: main
    secretRef:
      name: github-token  # For pushing branches and creating PRs
  ```

- **`kelos-agent`** — points at this repository (`kelos-dev/kelos`). Used by
  `kanon-config-update` and `kanon-self-update`, which edit the
  `self-development/kanon/` files that live here. This is the same Workspace
  `self-development/` already uses, so if you deployed those examples it
  already exists.

### 2. Repository labels

The Kanon repository starts with only the default GitHub labels. Create the
labels these spawners rely on (run once, against `kelos-dev/kanon`):

```bash
REPO=kelos-dev/kanon
gh label create generated-by-kelos --repo "$REPO" --color 1d76db --force
for l in kind/bug kind/feature kind/api kind/docs; do
  gh label create "$l" --repo "$REPO" --color 0e8a16 --force
done
for l in priority/important-soon priority/important-longterm priority/backlog; do
  gh label create "$l" --repo "$REPO" --color fbca04 --force
done
for l in actor/kelos actor/human; do
  gh label create "$l" --repo "$REPO" --color 5319e7 --force
done
for l in triage-accepted needs-actor needs-kind needs-priority needs-triage kelos/needs-input; do
  gh label create "$l" --repo "$REPO" --color c5def5 --force
done
```

- `generated-by-kelos` marks bot-created PRs and issues; `gh pr/issue create --label` fails without it.
- The `kind/*`, `priority/*`, `actor/*`, and lifecycle labels are applied by `kanon-triage`.
- `kelos/needs-input` is applied by `kanon-squash-commits`.

Unlike this repository, Kanon's CI runs on every PR, so there is **no
`ok-to-test` gate** and the spawners do not apply that label.

### 3. GitHub Token Secret

Create a secret with a GitHub token that has write access to both
`kelos-dev/kanon` and `kelos-dev/kelos` (needed for the `gh` CLI and git
authentication):

```bash
kubectl create secret generic github-token \
  --from-literal=GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-github-token>
```

The token needs `repo` (full control) and `workflow` (if your repo uses GitHub Actions).

### 4. GitHub Webhook Secret and Delivery

The issue and pull request TaskSpawners are webhook-driven. Reuse the
`github-webhook-secret` from your existing deployment, then configure a
repository webhook on `kelos-dev/kanon`:

- Point it at the same `https://<your-domain>/webhook/github` endpoint
- Use the same shared secret
- Subscribe to `issues`, `issue_comment`, and `pull_request_review`

Webhook TaskSpawners only react to **new** events after deployment. Retrigger an
existing issue or PR with a fresh comment or relabel if it was already in a
matching state.

### 5. Agent Credentials Secret

The spawners reuse the `kelos-credentials` secret (the AI agent credentials are
the same regardless of repository). The checked-in spawners use Codex OAuth:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic kelos-credentials \
  --from-file=CODEX_AUTH_JSON=$HOME/.codex/auth.json
```

For API-key auth, change the task template credential type to `api-key` and use
`--from-literal=CODEX_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>`.

## Customizing

The `TaskSpawner.spec.when.githubWebhook` filters and template variables work
exactly as in `self-development/`. See
[`self-development/README.md`](../README.md#customizing-for-your-repository)
for the webhook filter field reference and the full
[template variable table](../README.md), and
[docs/reference.md](../../docs/reference.md#taskspawner) for the authoritative
`TaskSpawner` field reference.

## Troubleshooting

**TaskSpawner not creating tasks:**
- Check the TaskSpawner status: `kubectl get taskspawner <name> -o yaml`
- Verify the Workspaces exist: `kubectl get workspace kanon-agent kelos-agent`
- Ensure credentials are configured: `kubectl get secret kelos-credentials`
- Ensure the GitHub webhook server is enabled and the `github-webhook-secret` exists
- Review the `kelos-dev/kanon` repository webhook's recent deliveries in GitHub

**Tasks failing immediately:**
- Verify the agent credentials are valid
- Check the Workspace repository is accessible and the token has push access to it
- Review task logs: `kubectl logs -l job-name=<job-name>`

**Triage or PR/issue creation failing on labels:**
- Confirm the labels from [Repository labels](#2-repository-labels) exist on `kelos-dev/kanon` — `gh` errors when adding or creating with a label that does not exist

## Next Steps

- Read the [main README](../../README.md) for more details on Tasks and Workspaces
- See [`self-development/`](../) for the equivalent setup that develops this repository
- Monitor task execution: `kelos get tasks` or `kubectl get tasks`
