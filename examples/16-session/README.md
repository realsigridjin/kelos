# Interactive Session

This example creates one Claude Code conversation in a dedicated one-replica
StatefulSet. It checks out an `interactive-review` branch and submits an initial
prompt before a client connects. Replace the API key placeholder, then apply the
files:

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/16-session/
kelos get session interactive-review
```

When the Session is `Ready`, connect from a terminal:

```bash
kelos session connect interactive-review
```

The terminal client prints commands when interaction is required. Use
`/interrupt` to stop active work and `/answer INPUT_ID QUESTION_ID VALUE` for a
provider question.

The same conversation is available in the Session web application when the
shared Session server is enabled. Disconnecting either client does not stop the
agent runtime. If the Pod or StatefulSet is removed, the controller recreates
it on the Session-owned persistent workspace; active work is marked interrupted
and both clients reconnect without replaying it. Deleting the Session deletes
its StatefulSet, Pod, governing Service, and persistent workspace and ends the
conversation:

```bash
kelos delete session interactive-review
```

To use another supported provider, set `spec.worker.type` to `codex` or
`opencode` and provide a credentials Secret with the corresponding
`CODEX_API_KEY` or `OPENCODE_API_KEY` key.
